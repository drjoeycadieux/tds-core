Make sure keyboard functionality works with VoiceOver and use alt text only where appropriate.

## Usage

See the [TELUS Standards site](https://digitalstandards.telus.com/accessibility) for detailed usage information.

## Governance

The TELUS digital accessibility is managed by Operations: Security and Accessibility. If you have any questions or concerns
