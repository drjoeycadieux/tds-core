## Getting started with Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is the new primary tool to design, collaborate, and share designs. It's a cloud-based design tool that is available on web browsers and desktop applications for macOS and Windows. Figma offers helpful [tutorials](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Getting-Started) to get to know the tool and start using it.

You can access Figma directly in your browser by visiting and logging into [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/), or [download the desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

- For TELUS Digital designers and content practitioners, contact your team's Design Lead to be invited to your respective Team Space
- For vendors or designers outside of TELUS Digital, we will provide exported Figma files for your use in your own design tools

## TDS Assets

### TDS libraries in Figma

The TELUS Design System are available as three Figma libraries:

- [TDS Core Styles](https://www.figma.com/file/yNTPe3uZ6b7uNPDzOwZIVa/%E2%8F%B3-TDS-Styles) - ([Download the local .fig file](https://telus-design-system-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/components/figma-files/tds-styles.fig))
- [TDS Core Components](https://www.figma.com/file/flEzyiqw23nzT1ZMo7kurv/%E2%8F%B3-TDS-Components) - {[Download the local .fig file](https://telus-design-system-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/components/figma-files/tds-components.fig))
- [TDS Core Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/2S4MsqHCJOZ8UGwu9nYrV7/%E2%8F%B3-TDS-Icons) - ([Download the local .fig file](https://telus-design-system-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/components/figma-files/tds-icons.fig))

Once you have access to your team space, you'll be able to access the TDS libraries using the Asset's panel on the left sidebar. You can pull in components and icons, and apply typography and colour styles. Check out the [guide to libraries in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma) for more information and detailed instructions on using libraries.

### TDS UI Sticker Sheet

The [TDS UI Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/file/VWoC6aqL5B2IUUuTQGHo3O/TDS-UI-Sticker-Sheet) provides a consolidated view of the available TDS Core components as well as a guide to using the TDS Core styles. ([Download the local .fig file](https://telus-design-system-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/components/figma-files/tds-ui-sticker-sheet.fig))

### Fonts

TELUS' primary typeface is Helvetica Neue which is available as a system font on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and later. No other fonts are needed to use the TDS libraries in Figma or TDS UI sticker sheet.

### Images

For nature, TELUS critters and devices images, please visit the [TELUS BrandHub](https://brand.telus.com/library/all?media_type%5B0%5D=media_images&imgcat=All&search_terms=&sort_by=created&sort_order=DESC) for a library of brand-approved images to use with your project. You will need your TELUS ID to log in or you can follow the instructions to sign up for a an account. There is an approval process to sign up for an account so make sure you allot time to it.

The brand team is working towards creating a library of lifestyle photography. Until then, use your preferred stock photography site to source lifestyle images if your project requires lifestyle photography. Where possible, please consider using images from the TELUS BrandHub before trying to source lifestyle photography.

Please follow the [TELUS Brand Photography Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/a/telus.com/file/d/0BzlWahrSc56DenY4YzBndm1mWkk/view?usp=sharing) for detailed information on usage and implementation of the images.

## Releases

The TELUS Design System team often makes design improvements to the TDS libraries and TDS UI sticker sheet. You can [access the version history](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754-View-a-file-s-version-history#Access_version_history) of each library and design file as long as you have view access to the file.

When TDS makes releases you will get notified the next time you open Figma. You'll get a notification letting you know that there are updates available within your file.
